'''
This code is an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model for detecting objects and generating their descriptions based on the COCO dataset.
Loading the necessary libraries and modules.
Loading and pre-processing COCO set data for the selected category of objects (for example, "dogs").
Loading object detection model and descriptions from pretrained weights.
Preparing data for training a GAN model, including loading images, annotations, and embedded vector representations (embeddings).
Building and training a generator (stage1_generator) and discriminator (stage1_discriminator) model based on the GAN architecture.
Create and train an adversarial model (adversarial_model) that combines a generator and a discriminator to train the generator to create realistic images and descriptions of objects.
Generation of new images and descriptions using the trained GAN model.
Additional features in the code include loading classes, embeddings, and filenames, as well as handling images and object bounding box data.
